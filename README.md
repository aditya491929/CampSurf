## Understand the File Structure
- Our main focus in the file structure would be on the `lib` folder
- In the `lib` folder we have the `main.dart` file which is used to make calls to all the screens and widgets used for the app
- Next we have the `\helper` folder which contains .dart files used for transitions and location services
- The `\models` folder contains a single file used to mark campsites on the map
- This is followed by the `\screens` folder which contains all the screens required for our app
    - `add_camp_screen.dart` - adding a campsite
